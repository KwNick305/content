                        Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel accommodation
                        for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr. Najem Houry
                        proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the sea. Magnificent
                        Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For information apply to
                        Mr. Najem Houry, Managing Director of Cyprus Hotel Co., Army Contractor,
                        Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia (on Railway) to
                        Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin Cathedral (now a mosque)
                        begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with other ancient ruins and the
                        Venetian fortifications, the finest in the world. Also the tower or palace, the
                        scene of “Othello'' and of Ford's “Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus
                        in the winter months is delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                    <head> THE UNREST IN THE PAR EAST. </head>
                    <p> Mr. Angus Hamilton has some interesting speculations as to what will happen
                        in the Par East when China and Japan really find themselves, the article
                        appearing in the third part of the "Harmsworth History of the World". </p>
                    <p> "Looking back at the conditions of Asia in the eighteenth shd nineteenth
                        centuries, and comparing them with those existing today, it will be noticed
                        that a wide a gulf separates Japan from China in the twentieth century As
                        then separated China from the rest of the Par East. On one side there is
                        Chins, anemotiofál, and only slightly irraptive; on the other there is
                        Japan, voicing the regeneration of Asia with raucous tones..... </p>
                    <p> "While China is commercially independent of the West, and Japan dependent
                        apon it, all branches of foreign industry cannot but view with alarm the
                        increasing aggressiveness of the spirit of independence now inspiring Asia
                        at the prompting of Japan. Obviously these signs are the indication of an
                        approaching cleavage between East and West, which, when tally attained, will
                        bear witness to the complete severance of the shackles bitherto enthralling
                        Asia to the interests and purposes of the West. </p>
                    <p> "It must not be forgotten that Japan already has achieved her complete
                        regeneration Thirty years hence China, no doubt, will have followed suit,
                        when federacy of the Far Eastern Powers may become an accomplished fact.
                        Byen it this moment such a union is possible, and its realisation would
                        impose upon all European Governments the immediate revision of their Asiatic
                        policies. </p>
                    <p> "At this time such a combination is hampered only by the unwillingness of
                        China to accept the suggestions of Japan in anything affecting the policy of
                        Asia, although, in spite of this objection, active reforming influences are
                        gre deally effecting important changes throughout the Chinese Empire. For
                        the momennt, therefore, Japan is content to tread alone the path she has
                        marked out, encouraging her subjects by example to exploit Asia for the
                        Asiatios, and to secure recognition of the doctrine of equality between the
                        white and Asiatic moes. </p>
                    <p> "If the full significance of this movement is not yet discernible, there is
                        enough evider to show that the problem will rank among the greatest that the
                        polities of the twentieth cen tary can disclose. Not only one part of the
                        civilised globe will be affected by the rise of dominant Asia, for the whole
                        world will be confronted equally with the necessity of resist ing whatever
                        indications may appear, If it is difficult to devise an arrangement short of
                        total exclusion that does not admit an annual influx of a large number of
                        Japanese, Chinese, Korean, or Indian immigrants into the lands affected by
                        this invasion, it is at least tolerably certain that if the existing flow of
                        Asiaties across the Pacific to America and Australasia continues unabated
                        for further decade, the areas now menaced will be inhabited by a white
                        minority. </p>
                    <p> "It appears evident that the continuation of the Far East under existing
                        conditions is doubtful, if not impossible, in view of the awakening of Asia
                        and the visible prejudices that Western democracy entertains against the
                        Asiatio. Yet if the clash of conflicting interests ultimately precipitātes a
                        struggle between the two great racial divisions of the world, there can be
                        no doubt that the moral teachings of humanity will be discredited." </p>

                        Kent, and spent his childhood in Italy; from which circumstance he acquired
                        that intimate knowledge of the Italian language which he never lost, and
                        which was of such value to him in after life. At the age of 18 he went to
                        Eton, afterwards going to Balliol College, Oxford, where he graduated as
                        B.A. in 1860. Upon leaving the University he enfered the profession of law,

                        season, are much thampered by the refusal of the shareholders to pay their
                        calls. I know many persons, who have refused, because they are quite unaware
                        ms to the exact position of the companies. Nobody knows what the directors
                        are doing And as nothing is ever published as to what these companies have
                        done or are doing, there is naturally a disinclination to probably throw
                        good money after bad if the company is on the brink of voluntary liquidation
                        or, bankruptey. Shareholders will not pay up in many cases unless the
                        direetors issue a temporary balance sheet certified by auditors, giving full
                        details of how the company stands. Such an honest line of poliey would lead
                        to many persona paying up all the calls dae.</p>

                        <p> The new venture turns out, as we surmised it would, to partake of the
                        Kamel-cum Blunt shade of opinion. A perusal of the editorial artiele makes
                        this perfectly plain. The style is not particularly edifying; there is too
                        much much of the cit and thrust method about it, reminding one of
                        thosedendly obcounters, which only take place on the transpoutine stage
                        However, we are not surprised that some writers in England, who are totally
                        irratze of the prevailing conditions here, should do pouse the cause of
                        Kamel, seeing that he is the one man in Egypt who has proved himself apable
                        of conducting a campaign. But this beating of the big drum must neem, to
                        those who know, fulsome nonsense since the chances of evacuation are, by
                        reason of recent allianons more remote than they were ever before. </p>

                        <p> Sir, I read in your last issue, what you have thought to be the goal of
                        the "Party of the People" i.e. "independence." But it was "oomplete
                        autonomy" and pot "independence that was mentioned in the virouler of the
                        "Party of the People". It is the present autonomy as authorized by Firms and
                        International Treaties with a little more, and that little is Chat the

                        understood from Hassan Pasha Abd al-Razik's declarations which showed the
                        aspirations of the Party and he means for their reslization. </p>

                        <p> Sir, -Under the above heading you recent ay published a letter signed
                        "Veritas" in which he "Secret History of Egypt, ato" by Mr. W.8. Blunt is
                        somewhat severely criticised. Your correspondent omitted to mention &amp;
                        rather im mortant fact in connection with the appearance of this book. It is
                        now several years since Arabi returned from exile to live in this country,
                        and ret not one Egyptian out of a thousand knows or cares anything about
                        him, and still leds about those whose tool he was in 1882. On hem all has
                        fallen what the Prench pathetical y call "la pâle fleur de l'oubli." But
                        this did mot at all suit Mr. Blunt's morbid craving for notoriety - "hine
                        illae lachrymie" --but for bis, his "Secret History" would probably never
                        have been written. However it will not long me remembered, and in a few
                        years, sotons and cene shifters alike, including Mr. Blant, will have passed
                        away, as your correspondent righty suggests, "unwept, unhonoured and unsung. </p>

                        the harbour works being The subject of s eparate article - </p>

                        the world, ut they will be surpassed by those now being rected by the

                        tons per day. </p>
                    <p> In Building a new town to order some histakes were inevitable, but one of
                        the Tareat errors of judgment of the erection of a magnifodat post once
                        building the most n-get-at-able site, which renders it more or less seless.
                        It might serve a useful purpose as an otel, which is badly needed, but even
                        then the site is against it. </p>
                    <p> BUTLDING MATERIAL The majority of the public buildings are of oraline
                        limestone, whieh has a very smart ppearance. It is objected that coral
                        anterial is far too soft and that the building </p>
                    <p> constructed most eventually collapse. There </p>

                        and this hould have been the rule throughout. The Wational Bank building

                    pendant laquelle on s'est payé le luxe d'un semblant d'animation, le calme plat

                <p>Nous recevons de notre correspondant de Londres, en date du 15 courant, les
                    lignes suiYantes, concernant la tenue du groupe égyptien sur cette place:</p>
                <p> "La tendance est en général faible et les transactions difficiles et
                    restreintes. Sur les principales valeurs il suffit d'une demande ou d'une offre
                    relativement, en temps normaux, peu importante pour influencer sensiblement les
                    cours. On peut attribuer cet état de choses surtout à la crise financière aux
                    Etats-Unis qui provoque la hausse des taux de toutes les Ban ques d'Europe et
                    qui bouleverse toutes nos Bourses. Il est vrai que la situation en Egypte
                    nécessite la continuation de ventes pour assainir les dossiers nantis, mais ces
                    ventes auraient été sbsorbées avec facilité si la situstion générale financière
                    avait été favorable. </p>
                <p>"Les taux de reports des positions de micourant à fin courant ont été dans les
                    environs de 8 % 11 %, et si la Banque d'Angleterre se voit obligé d'avancer son
                    taux actuel qui est de 7 %, les reports à la liquidation prochaine deviendront
                    très onéreux. Ce soir par suite de la continuation des demandes d'or pour
                    l'Amérique on craint d'un moment à l'autre l'élévation du taux de la Banque à
                    8%.</p>
                <p>"La National Bank a subi quelques fluctuations rapides, baissant à un moment à
                    près de 19 1/2 pour avancer plus tard à 20 3/8 et eldturer i 20 1/8. L'Agricole
                    avait baissé à un moment à 7 5/8, s'est relevée ensuite à 8 1/16 pour finir
                    inchangée à 7 15/16. La Daïra de 12 1/4 s haussé à 12 3,4 pour finir très faible
                    ce soir à 12 1/4. Sur les petites valeurs les affaires ont été pea importantes

                    <p>Mr. C. Steward Cox (Director of Egyptian nvestment and Agency, Ltd.) was
                        voted into the chair. Mr. Cox said: I have no objection</p>
                    <p>hatever to taking the chair if it is the unani mous wish of the creditors
                        that I should, but I want to make it quite clear that we have no nterest
                        whatever in the matter of the liquida tion, and never have had any interest,
                        except o far as we could to safeguard the interest of be creditors, and if
                        the meeting is not unaninous I would rather not do it. Mr. Cox was
                        unanimously voted into the chair.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said: I call upon Mr. Rowe, who acted as a member of the
                        Committee of Inspection in Egypt, to give some account of what happened
                        there. I think I will just again epeat that the Egyptian Investment and
                        geney have no interest in this matter what ver, that my Company took up the
                        business f liquidating the Brown business in Egypt at the solicitation of
                        Mr. Brown, and we agreed o begin to see whether we could so liquidate the
                        business as in the interests of the parties oncerned, and we here in London
                        heard othing about it except that Mr. Brown had made that request. The only
                        thing that we lid learn was from Mr. Hewett, one of our managers in
                        Egypt-who is present--that my ompany had the intention of liquidating the
                        usiness, without making any stipulation about muneration, for account of the
                        concerned,</p>
                    <p>the hope of certain agency business resulting or us, partly as a consequence
                        of assistance which had been given to creditors, and partly</p>
                    <p>ecause my company believes that we can do redit to any business when it is
                        put in our ands</p>
                    <p>Letter convening the meeting was read. fr. Rowe said as I happened to be in
                        Egypt at this particular time, I was put in the position f knowing perhaps
                        more about it than most of ou, and therefore I give you some explanaion of
                        these affairs.</p>
                    <p>*One or two letters I have received in reply to ny lotter convening the
                        meeting, complained hat the recipients had received no previous
                        ommunication, and so, perhaps, it may be as ell it I read to you the letter
                        which was sent,</p>
                    <p>presame, to all the creditors by Messrs. rown and Co.</p>
                    <p>Since arriving home I have received another atement of affairs from Mr.
                        Brown, dated Lay 20th, giving his liabilities as Ps. 26,722,051, ad assets
                        Ps. 2,220, 720. In many cases,</p>

                    <p> The question being asked Mr. Rowe as to whether consigument stook could be

                    <p> Apart from the list of sundry creditors in Mr. Brown's liabilities are the
                        two Banks, The Banque de Salonique Ps. 681,622, and Cassa li Sconto e di
                        Risparmio P. 416,415. These wo Banks have got in all the Bills they could
                        ret hold of; they are all drawn on Menors. R Brown and Co's own Bill forms,
                        no matter whose goods they are against. The Banks are well covered for their
                        amounts, and when they ve wiped off they will hand the Bille (balance ver to
                        the Liquidator, or Mr. Brown, * anybody duly appointed. With regard • stocks
                        beld in consignment, I can only ell you that in many cases part or all have
                        been sold and the money has gone into he Bank. I do not see how you are
                        going to separate one stock from another, or decide which Bill is against
                        which stock, as the goods of three or four creditors are lumped together </p>
                    <p> many cases and all on one Bill </p>
                    <p> In reply to a question from Messrs. Morgan, Drossley and Co.'s
                        representative, Mr. Rowe aid that we had no power to take possession of
                        anything, but that one member on the mommittee, Messrs. Rylands
                        representative, </p>
                    <p> ook possession of their stock, valued-I pelieve-at about £4,000, and to
                        which action </p>
                    <p> protested at the time. The representative of Messrs Morgan. Crossely and
                        Co., Ltd., said me would like to ask the chairman if Messrs. Rylands were
                        prepared to return those goods. </p>
                    <p> Messrs. Rylands' representative said that he mad no instructions from
                        Messrs. Rylands, that we only knew of this matter an hour ago and hould say
                        nothing at the present time pending instructions, but he could say Messrs.
                        Rylands would do the right thing. </p>
                    <p> Mr. Compton, of Messrs. J. Compton and Bons, said he would like to say that
                        he was present with Mr. Rowe in Egypt. The first thing uggested was that Mr.
                        Brown should be put hrough the Bankraptey Court. They took both egal and
                        commercial advice, with the result hat everyone strongly advised their
                        keeping out of the court. </p>
                    <p>It is of the greatest importance that some hing abould be done at once, there
                        is stock here and money coming in, and no one has any authority to act on
                        behalf of the creditors, and that was the reason of calling this meeting.
                        Messrs Brown's books have not been audited for three or four years.</p>
                    <p> Mr. Compton said he very much doubted if Mr. Kerr (tho Accountant) would
                        take the responsibility of Deed of Assignment execured in his favour.
                        Neither could we (the Committee) take the responsibility of that Deed; and
                        release Mr. Brown of his indebtedness to ms, and give him a free hand. We
                        were legally advised on the other side that when Mr. Brown signed that Deed
                        we had ao further call on him. </p>
                    <p> Of course we had no control over sendng these letters out, because we had no
                        dea who Messrs. Brown's creditors were, we imply signed the letters placed
                        before us. I hink I shall give you better ides of the tate of affairs if I
                        tell you what happened in vor own case (Messrs. Hoskins and Sewell), I vent
                        out there on information received that hings were not as they might be. When
                        I jot to Alexandris I had a letter put before me, </p>
                    <p> which Mr. Brown says, "that for various Basons, his managers leaving him,
                        and one hing and another, he will have to suspend pay. ment for the time
                        being, and that he thinka it mpossible to carry on his business, and one of
                        he reasons he gives is the impossibility of inding an honest man in the
                        country, and so n." That is how I found the position when I jot to
                        Alexandria. The letter was dated Ird May, 1907. </p>
                    <p> Then I went immediately into the question vith Mr. Brown with regard to our
                        accounts, nd the stock we had in the country, and I aked Mr. Brown to let me
                        know how that tock stood. After several days, I found that at of about
                        £1,000 stock only about £100 emained unsold, and of this we had no advice </p>
                    <p>cash. Then I went on to our outstanding ccounts in the country, which Mr.
                        Brown ool noted as our agent, we paying him commision : and I found that a
                        large number of these ccounts had been collected and the money ad not been
                        remitted home, and the major ortion of the remainder was covered by Bills
                        rawn on R. Brown and Co.'s forms. There Tere Bills which we had drawn on him
                        falling ne at an early date, and I found there was no kelihood of their
                        being met at due date. This as at the beginning of May.</p>
                    <p> Then Messrs. Rylands' representative arrivd, and also Mr. Compton, and their
                        cases I elieve are identical with ours. Mr. Brown promised us to make a
                        statement This affairs at the end of that week. His statelent when presented
                        showed liabilities, £80,000, nd assets £28,000. But that statement was of
                        pry little use as it was found to be not at all prrect, and made up to March
                        30th only. </p>
                    <p> We three-Mr. Southworth, Mr. Compton nd myselt--then formed ourselves into .
                        ommittee of Inspection to protect the inrest of the creditors, and went to
                        Cairo to peat the stock and check it. Needless to my </p>
                    <p> did not find it correct. Finding it was seless to rely upon Mr. Brown to
                        give us ny true idea of his affairs, we consulted Lesers Rassell, Korr and
                        Wyatt, of Alexadria, Chartered Accountants, and asked them </p>
                    <p>examine Mr. Brown's books and prepare a atement of affairs showing the
                        position up to oth May, 1907. The report has not reached</p>
                    <p> yet. Mr. Kerr told me it would take at ast four to six week, ie, may be
                        finished by he end of next week. </p>
                    <p> We thought, however, instead of waiting for his report, that it was very
                        necessary that the sets should be secured; we have absolutely b control over
                        Mr. Brown at the present me, and we think it is very Decorary that </p>

                        and, therefore on behalf of the committee I have called this meeting, and
                        ask you to consent to the appointment of a liquidator. </p>
                    <p> Mr. Rowewas then asked if any other creditor had taken possession of their
                        goods, and replied that to his knowledge they had not. Messrs. Rylands took
                        possession about the 22nd. May. </p>
                    <p> The Chairman said that so far as he understood the matter, Messrs Rylends'
                        goods were there without any charge on them, and he believed they had every
                        justification for their action; but he expressed no opinion on the subject,
                        except to assure them that Messrs. Rylands would undoubtedly do what was
                        right. </p>
                    <p> The Solicitor of Egyptian Investment and Agency. Ltd. - Mr. Leveaux-said
                        that Mr. Kerr had already refused to obtain a Deed of Assigament, and it was
                        highly necessary for the creditors to appoint somebody to represent them </p>
                    <p> It was then proposed that the meeting should be adjourned until the accounts
                        from the auditors had come to band. Mr. Compton said that while these
                        matters were being discussed home provisional arrangements should be made,
                        and suggested that the Meeting should empower the Egyptian Investment and
                        Agency to protect ther interests. </p>
                    <p>After a good deal of discussion it was pro: posed by Mr. Payne, and seconded
                        by Mr. Kilner, that a cable be sent to Egypt to the accountants, to know if
                        the statement that has been mentioned had been sent off, or if mot, when it
                        will be sent off, and that another meeting of creditors be called on the
                        infor mation being received</p>
                    <p> Messrs. Rylands then agreed to submit the question of their retaining their
                        stock as mentioned above to arbitration, granted that they approved of the
                        arbitrator or counsel employed for the purpose. </p>
                    <p> It was then proposed by Mr. Compton, and seconded by Mr. Hoskins, that the
                        Deed of Assignment as drawn, appointing the Egyptfian Investment and Agency
                        as Liquidators, be approved, subject to amendment by Messrs. Rylands'

                        their stock could be legally justified or not. Messrs. Rylands undertaking
                        to hand back the stock or its value to the stato in the latter event, the
                        cost of arbitration being charged to the estate. This was carried

                        given in Messrs. Rylands favour. </p>
                    <p> There are numeroas creditors who have sent foods on consignment, some of

                        such sales have ncluded the goods of numerous firms, in one ransaction,
                        while bills appear to have been Irawn by Richard Brown and Co., and placed
                        rith their bankers or otherwise negotiated, so hat it will be seen it will
                        be impossible to smark goods which have been so dealt with </p>
                    <p> where cash has been received in respect of pods sent on consignment and not
                        remitted, and it was felt that if such manufacturers comhenoed proceedings
                        for the retom of any pode sent by them, litigation must ensue, fith the

                        creditors. </p>
                    <p> It was suggested that the wisest course in this now would be for all to

                        conditional on this course being adopted, to return the bills received by
                        them amounting to about £2,000 (retaining the goods they already hold). It
                        was therefore resolved that the creditors be recommended to assent to the
                        estate being assigned for the benefit of creditors, and that the Egyptian

                        whilst Good is aduced to plb. Uppers are unchanged. </p>
                    <p> A fair business has been done in Putores, od the following are the latest
                        quotations - Tov. 9.53 Feb. 9.46 May 9.45 Ang. 9.47 </p>

                    <p> Nov. 9.32 American Futures. The Market this week as been in a very unbettled
                        state, at one time me feeling was strong with a substantial </p>
                    <p> yance in prices, there being a feeling that mancial matters in America were
                        less acute, at later there was less buoyancy and the Tarket reacted
                        somewhat. </p>
                    <p> Bad weather was reported from the Cotton Lates, with Frost in some sections.
                        It is owever too late for frost to do much injury, till it may stop further
                        growth. </p>
                    <p> There is, we think, a more confident feeling nd many consider that Cotton at
                        about 5 b. is by no means dear if the monetary </p>
                    <p> sition in the United States were in a more ottled state. There is however
                        almost a total bsence of outside speculation, the fluctuations </p>
                    <p>prices in the market being merely due to e Room operators taking a view one
                        side or ne other for the time being.</p>
                    <p> We fear it may be some time before the mosphere is clear enough for people
                        to take calm view of the position after so serious a Dancial crisis. </p>
