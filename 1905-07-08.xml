                        greatly increased the ner- vousness of Turkish offici in Syria and

                        subordinate police officials welcome, if they do not bring about, these
                        nervous fits on the part of the authorities which, no doubt, give them sin-

                    <p>Dear Sir,—Asa resident of Ghezireh it has | occurred to me that with the
                        assistance of others &amp; campaign may well be started against the
                        mosquitoes with the idea of reducing their numbers, as they are at present a
                        pest. I have</p>
                    <p>tried all kinds of preparations, such as mos-</p>
                    <p>quito terrors and othef8, and I find that al- though my acquaintances are
                        inclined to avoid me in consequenéé, the mosquitoes are mote’ attentive than
                        ever. There are many gentle- men in Government positions with nothing to
                        do—I beg their pardon, I mean with spare</p>

                    <p> </p>
                    <p>of reptiles and flies and mosquitoes. ‘I'he corps might be called the G. A.M.
                        B. (Ghezireh Anti- | Mosquito Brigade) and it would not take long | to
                        appoint a commandant and a permanent | staff. Although I should object to
                        ladies in</p>
                    <p>‘administrative appointments, there is no reason</p>
                    <p>why they should not join the rank and file, provided they are medically fit
                        and active. Of | course at present there is no necessity for a band or @
                        distinctive uniform, but that would no doubt come in time. As a temporary
                        measure oil might be obtained from the street lamps, but if the corps got
                        popular, recruits on join- ing might provide themselves with bottles of
                        paraffio, and tlie large hotels and officers on promotion might present it
                        by the barrel. My proposal is to attract the mosquitoes with some of the
                        numerous anti-mosquito solutions laid down in soup plates,and once having
                        got t) destroy them with paraffin oil. [</p>

                    <p>The exploratory work in North Khargeh is producing the most satisfactory
                        results. The investigation of the ancient Roman irrigation channels has
                        disclosed the existence cf several very extensive subterranean water
                        conduits connected by manholes conveying water over a large area. A
                        stone-faced well 10 feet in diameter was discovered, which could not be
                        cleared beyond 15 feet with the appliances at immediate command, the volume
                        of water discharging being foo great.</p>

                    <p>The profits that have been made on loans on land in this country by the
                        Credit Foncier,</p>
                    <p>as” shown in an article that appeared in our: columns recently, and the
                        handsome dividends.</p>
                    <p>paid by this institution, have in a way attracted the attention of a few of
                        the English insur- ance companies, yet, strange as it may seem, considering
                        the excellent security offered, we</p>
                    <p>‘are given to understand that there is still</p>
                    <p>much difficulty encountered in attempting to obtain loans in England on the
                        ‘secürity of real property in this country, notwith- standing that the
                        advance asked is generally on the best lands at half the estimated value.
                        Another fact that strikes one is that the local institutions that have been
                        doing for years a lucrative business in this line, foremost amongst which is
                        the Credit Foncier, have made very few bad debts, the losses being so small
                        that they are scarcely con- sidered as worth mentioning in the annual
                        reports. ‘The erection of palatial new premises by the latter institution
                        ata cost of a million francs is another and a #uflicient proof of the
                        excellence of this description of business. With such facts staring usin the
                        face, we repeat it is passing strange that financiers and others in the
                        United Kingdom should still hesitate’to lend money on real property in ‘this
                        country, where land has been for the Igst.ten years or so rapidly increasing
                        in value, and i8 still doing so. As a general rule invest- ments in that
                        class of security are, we should say, quite as safe as those in Unified or
                        Domains Loans. '</p>

                    <p>A few weeks ago one of Our correspondents gave us some interesting figures of
                        the value ot land both in London and New York. The following, which we have
                        extracted from the “Times” of last week, will prove interesting reading for
                        those who have been investing their money in land in Cairo and Alexandria.

                        land values in Lendon, the first Capital in the world, and Cairo, the first

                    <p>Tue Property Market.—At the Auction Mart in ‘l'okenhouse-yard, yesterday, Mr.
                        Bousfield submitted for letting by auction the site upon which Nos. 75 and
                        76, Lombard- street are at present standing. The particulars of sale
                        contained a condition that the ground: rent was to be fixed by competition,
                        the purchaser having the right to prrchase this ground-rent at such a sum as
                        would, if invested in Consols, prodace the same-inecome as the ground-rent.
                        The bidding started at £2,000 perannum ground-rent and ran up to £3,000 per
                        annum, at which it was knocked down to a client of Mr. M. E. Collins, the
                        architect. This works out at about £67 10s. per square foot, and, if the
                        purchaser exercises his option to purchase the necessary Consols, at present
                        ptice they will cost abont £108,000.</p>

                    <p>A Fayoulm correspondent writes :— On Mon- day last, as the ‘Tamish train was
                        about to leave the Fayoum station, it was derailed.. One or two of the
                        coaches were much damaged by being in contact with the irop pillars which
                        support the iron station roof, some of them baing displaced. The passengers
                        fortunate'y got off with a severe shaking. Again, on Thars- day the
                        Shawashna train, due at Fayoum at 3 p.m., arrived at 4.45 p.m., nearly two
                        hours late, and tomake matters worse it was also derailed and caused
                        considerable damage to the lines before the engine could be stopped. We
                        unfortunate travellers arrived back at Shawashna at 10 p.m. This certainly
                        gives you plenty~f6r your money, but ofa kind not valued, and itis really
                        astonishing how many people now take a donkey when they wish to catch the
                        Cairo connection.</p>

                    <p>I put myself in charge of the station-master as soon asl arrived at Ma’an and
                        rashed into the station building amid clouds of dust blown by a hurricane.
                        As soon as the train had steamed off toa siding and all the work con- nected
                        with its arrival had been done, the guards, porters, brakesmen, etc.,
                        trooped into the station cursing, swearing, and wiping their eyes. They
                        explained that there always was dust and sand at Ma’4n but that “never in
                        the memory-of the oldest*inhabitant, etc.,” had a storm come up so suddenly
                        as this. Then the station-master interposed ; he had had much experience of
                        railways in the Ottoman Empire, he had been on the Smyrna line and on the
                        Anatolian, and he had been two years at Ma’in. Who could know more about the
                        wind at Ma’in than himself, who had grown grey- haired from work and
                        discomfort in the last eighteen months? The wind was often a thousand times
                        worse !</p>
                    <p>The weather was then dropped’ and the visitor came up for cross-examination.
                        I survived the ordeal and had a good deal of conversation with the
                        station-master and his assistants, who were all curiously thickly clad,
                        wearing high boots, neckcloths, and woollen</p>
                    <p>| jerseys in spite of a temperature of close</p>
                    <p>907°</p>
                    <p>The village of Ma’an is some forty minutes by mule from the station and
                        contains nothing of interest except the ruins of an old wall. Its
                        inhabitants lived by smuggling and gun- running till recently and are now
                        driven to live by pilfering or doing any work they can find on the line,
                        their old trades being more dangerous though still very Incrative. Like
                        their kinsmen at Wadi Musa (Petra) they have a bad name for insolencé and
                        rapacity, and those who keep goats or fowls charge the Turkish troops the
                        most exorbitant prices for niilk or eggs. The Kaimakam is said to be rather
                        heavy-handed but no doubt they deserve it. The picturesque Bedouin of
                        romance is utterly despised by every Turk or Circassian, and when you see
                        the races together, you understand why the Nor- therner nearly always
                        wins—when he can tackle his opponent. The Yemen affair,be it re- membered,
                        is not a war of Turks and Be- douins. The Arabs of South Arabia are town and
                        village dwellers, agriculturalists and traders, descended. from the Sabeans
                        and Mineans, who w great and - civilised in King Solomon’s days; no doubt
                        there are plenty of Bedouing on their side, but the settled Arabs are thé
                        core of the re volt, -just asin the Sudan, when the success of the Mahdi was
                        assured by the defection of the riverain Arabs from the Egyptian Govern-
                        ment.</p>
                    <p>I got very little information at Ma’an of either the war in the Yemen or the
                        progress of the railway. Beyond Ma’in the rails have been laid for perhaps 5
                        or 6 miles, the embank- ments for 30, and the surveys ot the route have been
                        pushed some 60 miles more to theysouth. At Batn el Ghoul (The Devil’s Belly)
                        south of Ma’an there is said to be good water and the,air is so magnificent
                        that Mr. Meissner dreams of a sanatorium that will vie with Helouan and
                        Biskra.”</p>
                    <p>Ma’én on the other hand is badly off for drinking water, which comes from
                        Katranéh in iron tanks by--traia. The wells supply water, which is good
                        enough for the engines,</p>
                    <p>on</p>
                    <p>but when drunk -by homan beings often.</p>
                    <p>produces unpleasant effects.</p>
                    <p>At about 4p.m. the winddropped a little and 1 went out fora walk. The camp
                        and the neighbourhood of the railway were disgust- ingly filthy There was no
                        sanitation whatever, and during the two or three years in which troops had
                        been posted there, nothing seemed to have been done to keep the camp clean.
                        The dryness of the air and the fact that no one drank the Ma’An water alone
                        prevented an epidemic. The dispersed groups of tents which made up the camp
                        were pitched on sandy places where the ~stones had been~ removed for
                        ballasting the line and the dust and sand that blew about were impregnated
                        with cor-</p>
                    <p>ruption. North of the camp wasa low rounded</p>
                    <p>ridge. covered with dark grey stones. Some miles to the south a long
                        escarpment of lime- stone rock, shaped like the Jebel Hoft at Helouan rose
                        from the plain and ran from S.E. to N. W. The view on the west was shut in
                        by numerous low kopjes but beyond them I could distinguish a high range of
                        lifeless black hills, beyond which lay the Akaba depression. On the east was
                        a perfect and abso- lute blank. The blf&amp;ck desert spread like a sea,
                        unbroken and unrelieved except by the peak that may—or may not—have been Ras

                    <p>It was so extraordinarily lonely and desolate that I felt sure that it would
                        one day be ‘developed’ by some of those ingenious persons who, on finding a
                        region unsuited to animal or vegetable life, jump to the conclusion that it

                    <p>THE REVOLT IN RUSSIA.</p>
                    <p>“TIMES." </p>
                    <p>The news which reaches us from Odessa is the strongest confirmation yet to
                        hand that the apprehensions we have expressed as to the internal condition
                        of Russia are not exaggerated. In any ordinary European State possessed of a
                        more highly organised political and social life, the events which have
                        occurred would probably be regarded as the forerunners of a general
                        convulsion, if not as the tokens of impending dissolution. That would be a
                        large assumption to make in Russia, where the body politic is so loosely
                        knit that the maladies of its outlying members do not necessarily affect the
                        vital organs to the same mortal degree as in societies of a more developed
                        type. But even in Russia they are evidence of profound social disorder which
                        may prove pregnant with the gravest consequences to the Government and to
                        the established institutions of the Empire. For the first time we have
                        proofs, which cannot be denied or explained away, that at least a portion of
                        the bureaucracy can no longer be trusted. . . . . . . . . Whatever may have
                        been the actual occasion of the explosion, its causes are plainly of long
                        standing and of a general kind. Probably corruption, harshness,
                        incompetence, and levity have all helped to bring it about. If the Russians
                        cannot quell it themselves, it is not easy to see how foreign subjects and
                        foreign property are to be protected.</p>
                    <p>"DAILY TELEGRAPH." </p>
                    <p>Through all the various and often contradictory reports which are coming in
                        from seats of disturbance in the Russian Empire there runs one constant and
                        dreadful note of impending revolution. The news of this morning adds to and
                        confirms the terror of yesterday. What might have seemed, on a hasty
                        perusal, an isolated and disconnected outrage at Odessa is now seen to be
                        only a single symptom of widespread discontent and disaffection which are
                        eating into the vitals of Tsardom and Russian autocracy. Has it really come
                        to this, that the ugly spectre of Revolt, so often foreseen and so often
                        derided, so much dreaded in Western Europe and so diligently deprecated by
                        competent observers and interested politicians in the Northern Empire
                        itself, is now no phantom of a superstitious imagination, but an awful shape
                        of Evil, holding red ruin in both hands, and visibly destroying the fabric
                        of constituted authority? We cannot tell as yet, until some of the mists are
                        cleared away. But many signs and evidence, multiplying each hour. seem to
                        point that way.</p>
                    <p>"STANDARD." </p>
                    <p>As yet the discipline of the military has withstood even the terrible strain
                        of recent events, but the most flippant or sanguine of courtiers can hardly
                        affect unshakeable confidence that at the critical moment the reservists,
                        who are engaged in repressing local tumults may not at the critical moment
                        fraternise with the mob. For men impressed with this fear the most carefully
                        guarded recesses of the Palace may well appear insecure. This, however, is
                        to anticipate a future which, if good counsels prevail, may never become a
                        gloomy present.</p>
                    <p>"DAILY NEWS." </p>
                    <p>Red ruin and the breaking up of laws continue in Russia. Now it is in St.
                        Petersburg, now Moscow, now Warsaw, now Lodz. Yesterday it was Odessa,
                        to-day Libau--but from each place come the same unfailing symptoms of a
                        system going to pieces. The incident of the mutiny, springing dramatically
                        out of the appeal of the sailors for decent food, shows that the Navy is
                        like tinder, ready to take fire at a moment's notice. And as with the Navy
                        so with the Army. The elements of disaffection are everywhere, and the end
                        is inevitable.</p>
                    <p>"MANCHESTER GUARDIAN.” </p>
                    <p>It is too soon to predict what influence the acceleration which begins to
                        show itself in the pace with which Russia is moving towards open and general
                        revolt may have upon the consels of the autocracy. The Tsar's conciliatory
                        speech of last week has been explained and mutilated by the Censor. General
                        Trepoff is being installed by gradual stages as military dictator, and
                        Poland is expecting to be placed under martial law. So long as the more
                        menacing movements were confined to the non-Russian populations of Poland
                        and the Caucasus these evidences of severity were quite intelligible. But
                        the startling news from Odeşsa shows that the area of disturbance is
                        spreading over the densely populated agricultural and industrial region of
                        which it is the port.</p>
                    <p>"EVENING STANDARD." </p>
                    <p>"We Englishmen cannot get rid of our sympathy for a people as against a
                        tyrant. A troublesome habit of mind it may be constantly adding difficulties
                        to the country's foreign policy. Yet we would not change it if we could. No
                        doubt it renders the modified satisfaction with which English readers peruse
                        the news of the Russian mutiny <cb n="2"/> liable to be misunderstood. In no
                        wise is the feeling due to hatred of Russia. It is but the outcome of our
                        sympathy with the people of a great country in their fight against a native
                        oppressor. We hail the mutiny, not because we approve of mutinies or want to
                        kick Russia while she is on the ground, but because it furthers the day when
                        bureaucracy will be shattered, when a noble people will be freed from their
                        chains, when Russia will take her rightful place among the Powers. We think
                        of what she might do in Europe if she were governed in the spirit of
                        freedom, and we hail with some sort of pleasure anything which seems to
                        further the era of her emancipation.</p>

                    <p>Apart from the terrors of such a condition of anarchy in a busy commercial
                        seaport city, the situation is wildly romantic enough to form material for
                        the most imaginative writer--a great battleship manned with seamen who have
                        broken away from the iron discipline of naval service and who yet pay for
                        the coal they commandeer. Signs of a spread of the mutiny in the Russian
                        Navy are reported both from the Black Sea and the Baltic, and these symptoms
                        of disaffection appear to be causing serious alarm amongst the officials in
                        St. Petersburg, who reálise at last that the outbreaks of the people are not
                        merely sporadic incidents, but that revolution faces them. Whether the
                        rulers will attempt to remove the causes or whether they will devote
                        themselves to repressing the effects of discontent remains to be seen. </p>
                    <p>FRANCE AND GERMANY.</p>
                    <p>"ECLAIR.” </p>
                    <p>The "Eclair” says it has reason to believe that the German Government has
                        come to a decision calculated to render the solution of the Morocco incident
                        much more easy. "The German Government," it says, "had hitherto refused to
                        outline the programme which is to be submitted to the international
                        conference. It has, nevertheless, consented to come to an explanation with
                        us on certain points of the Morocco question. Prince von Bülow has decided
                        to take another step forward in our direction. It is announced, in fact,
                        that he is now determined to confer with the French Government on the
                        details of the Morocco problem, and it is stated that in order to do so he
                        is about to send an expert on colonial questions charged with a special
                        mission to Paris, namely, Dr. Rosen, who is expected to succeed Count
                        Tattenbach. Dr. Rosen, it is said, will be attached to Prince Radolin, in
                        relation to whom he will fill the same part in the negotiations as M. Revoil
                        in relation to M. Rouvier. </p>
                    <p>"Echo De Paris." </p>
                    <p>The "Echo de Paris” publishes a long article by a member of the Reichstag
                        tending to show that the idea of the German Government is to impose upon
                        France complete political effacement behind Germany. The same journal says:
                        "It is not probable that M. Rouvier will be able to give his answer to the
                        German Note to-day. We are moving in the direction of a Conference, but this
                        solution of the question is not yet ready. M. Rouvier on Wednesday had a
                        further conversation with Prince Radolin, in the course of which things took
                        a turn for the better."</p>
                    <p> “AURORE." </p>
                    <p>M. Clemenceau remarks in the "Aurore”:--"As regards our <hi rend="italic"
                            >rapprochement</hi> with England, nobody in Europe can conceal from
                        himself that the attempt of Germany to introduce the iron wedge under the
                        pretext of damaging it has so lamentably failed that the two people whom it
                        was sought to divide are closer together than ever. The acceptance of the
                        conference by French diplomacy in the conditions I have mentioned is the
                        victory of Germany. The resistance to the test and the increased stability
                        of the <hi rend="italic">entente cordiale</hi> is the victory of
                        France."</p>
                    <p> "TEMPS." </p>
                    <p>There can be no question for the moment of trespassing on the work eventually
                        reserved for the conference. The questions at present under consideration
                        are, first, whether France and Germany will enter into an exchange of views
                        before the conference is held ; second, when will that take place ? third,
                        how will it take place ? As those questions have not been solved, an entente
                        has not been concluded. Therefore, if there is reason to rejoice at the <hi
                            rend="italic">détente</hi>--that is to say, at the desire for
                        conciliation and the good-will which now prevail in the Franco-German
                        negociations, and which make it reasonable to anticipate a satisfactory
                        issue, it is, nevertheless, premature to congratulate ourselves as yet on
                        the final agreement of the two Governments. </p>
                    <p> "FRANKFURTER ZEITUNG” (Berlin). </p>
                    <p>The "Frankfurter Zeitung," which for the time being has been made semi
                        official with the object of interesting the commercial classes in the policy
                        of the Government, learns from Berlin that a rapid decision on the part of
                        the French Cabinet is desirable, "not only because delay is in all
                        circumstances not unattended with danger, but also because when once the
                        conference has been accepted the understanding (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>)
                        between Germany and France, which, of course, will not amount to a separate
                        agreement, will be able to make progress." </p>

                    <p>The annual dinner of this association, which is composed mainly of 'old boys”
                        of the Mohamedan Oriental College, Aligarh (United Province), was held on
                        Tuesday week at the Hotel Cecil, London. Lord Rear, the president, occupied
                        the chair, and the company included Mr. Theodore Morison, the retiring
                        principal of the college ; Mr. W.A.J. Archbold, the principal elect; Major
                        General Dickson, Sir C. Jehangir, Sir Charles Lyall, Sir Charles Stevens,
                        Mr. A.N. Wollaston, Dr. Pollen, Mr. F.H. Skrine, Colonel C.J.O. Fitzgerald,
                        Syed Amir Ali, late Judge of the Bengal High Court, Major Syed Hassan, Mr.
                        Hafiz Hidayat Hosain, Sheikh Abdul Qadir, and Syed Ali Bilgrami. Dr. Pollen,
                        in proposing the toast of "The College,” said its number of students
                        increased from 560 in 1902 to 700 last year, and they came from every part
                        of the Indian Empire. It was a model institution, and the only college in
                        India which at all resembled the public schools of England. The model was so
                        well approved throughout India that the Hindu College at Benares had adopted
                        it. More scholarships and a well-equipped scientific laboratory were greatly
                        needed. It was desired also to establish a faculty of science. Syed Amir Ali
                        responded. Major Syed Hassan proposed "The Retiring Principal and the
                        Principal-Elect," and Mr. Morison and Mr. Archbold responded. Sir Charles
                        Lyall proposed the toast of the association, and Mr. Hafiz Hidayat Hosain
                        responded. </p>

                    <head> NATURE AND MAN. </head>
                    <p>Professor Ray Lankester, who lectured on "Nature and Man" at Oxford recently,
                        formulated his views on the duty of Oxford to the nation and humanity. He
                        was convinced, he said, that the true relation of Nature to man had been so
                        clearly ascertained that it should be the guide of State government and the
                        trusted basis of the development of human communities. The knowledge and
                        control of Nature being "man's destiny and his greatest need,” Professor Ray
                        Lankester desires to make the chief subject of education, both in school and
                        college, a knowledge of Nature as set forth in physics, chemistry, geology,
                        and biology. "In fact, he would wish to see the classical and historical
                        scheme of education entirely abandoned, and its place taken by a scheme of
                        education in the knowledge of Nature." If the ancient Universities set the
                        example, the schools would follow suit, and the results would be apparent in
                        the greater efficiency of the governing class of the country. Professor Ray
                        Lankester may be right, but we cannot see how the wholesale elimination from
                        the educational system of all influences that tend to build up character is
                        likely to improve the breed of politicians, statesmen, administrators, or
                        the learned professions. As the "Times” happily observes, there is just as
                        little to be said for being a mere “scarabeist” as there is for being a mere
                        grammarian. Physics, chemistry, geology, and biology untempered by the
                        humanities will no more produce a Lord Cromer than they will produce a
                        Huxley. </p>

                    <p>Some curious statistics are published about the tastes of Paris as to the
                        photographs of celebrities. The picture post-card craze has done immense
                        harm to the trade in these photographs, though a few are still sold. Of King
                        Alfonso during his stay in France some 10,000 were sold. The favorite
                        photographs at present are those of Russian and Japanese generals and
                        admirals ; then come those of the Czar and Czarina, with the Kaiser in the
                        third category. Prominent French statesmen and politicians are a drug in the
                        market, but something may still be done with those of theatrical "stars."

                        comprehensive issued. It grows not only in size but in the artistic
                        character of get-up and illustrations. It is to-day receiving more favorable
                        comments than all others combined, and is the recognised buyers' guide of
                        Nottingham's best goods at lowest prices. The Peach curtains are certainly
                        not to be surpassed in artistic merit, wear and durability, and as regards
                        price it is sufficient to say that better value cannot be obtained. All
                        classes of laces, fancy table centres, sideboard covers, Madras muslins also

                        is becoming the manufacturing centre and employs thousands of girls in this
                        industry. The list also contains hosiery, and underwear for ladies, gents
                        and children at direct loom prices. The linen department at the end of the
                        catalogue is full of choice new goods. New designs of damask by the yard,
                        table cloths and embroidered tea cloths. Sideboard covers, bed spreads, and
